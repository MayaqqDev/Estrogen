## `Information`

> [!TIP]
> **[EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi)/[JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)/[REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei)** is highly recommended to be installed with this mod to see all the recipes and
> progression!

Create Addon Based around expressing yourself, fluid handling and expanding your factory. This mod add a lot of new
Items, Blocks, Mechanics and more!

### `Main Features`

The main feature of the mod is the Estrogen Pill (And its effect)! Automated through a process of fluid handling and
item processing. This might be pretty tough to get to, but the reward is great! The Estrogen Effect gives you an effect
allowing you to **Dash** (With some hidden abilities too)!

To Dash, simply have the Estrogen Pill effect (Called Girl Power in game) and click [X], if that does not work, you may
need to rebind the key in the Minecraft control settings or rebind any key that uses the same key. Then it should be
smooth dashin' from there!

This mod also features a [complete soundtrack](https://erora.bandcamp.com/album/create-estrogen) that automatically plays while you have the Girl Power effect. 
To hear it, make sure you have your music sound category turned up!

### `Additional Features`

This mod adds a lot of other features related to Estrogen and its production. This includes but is not limited to:

- a new block called the Centrifuge, with a new mechanic for fluid processing which is used to make the Estrogen fluid.
